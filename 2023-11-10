Report for the Date : 2023/11/10
Name : Kasha Singh
ITE No : ITE001456
Things I did today : 
1. Learnt about working of LiDar sensor
-> How it captures data
-> Point cloud
-> Format of json file: position, dimensions and heading angle(centroid)

2. Learnt about concepts of custom dataset training
-> Using dataset for pedestrians captured using LiDar sensor and totalstation
-> Labeling the pedestrian dataset by drawing bounding boxes 
-> Getting the heading angle of the pedestrians using their trajectories
-> Then training the model for pedestrians

3. Learnt about testcases of the model
-> Testcases when the robot was static and the pedestrian was moving
-> Testcases when the robot was moving and the pedestrian was static
