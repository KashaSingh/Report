-> Property
-> Used it for finding nearest neighbour
-> Optimized the code for RRT* using R tree

2. Optimized the code for search space in RRT*

3. Wrote the code for obstacle generator in RRT*
-> Analyzed how the position of obstacles affects the optimal path

4. Used plotting functions in python to visualize the optimal path
