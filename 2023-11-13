Report for the Date : 2023/11/13
Name : Kasha Singh
ITE No : ITE001456
Things I did today : 
1. Studied sampling-based algorithms for optimal motion planning
-> RRT
-> RRT*

2. Compared RRT and RRT* using an example simulation
-> RRT* improves by rewiring the tree to form shortest paths

3. Tried to optimize the code for RRT* algorithm using a bad implementation

4. Learnt about navigating a simulated Turtlebot3 in the gazebo simulator
-> 2DPoseEstimate
-> Navigation2 Goal
